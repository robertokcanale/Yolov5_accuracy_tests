==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on March 30, 2021 at 8:42 AM GMT

It includes 4446 images.
Palm-Thumb-Finger-ObjDet are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -50 and +50 percent
